<title>Application Deployment</title>

<simplesect>

	<para>This appendix details the procedure for deploying your application on all target platforms. You need to be in control of the versions of all external libaries, Dabo, and your application, which basically means some sort of runtime library for Dabo is necessary. The story is a bit different for developing Dabo applications - for that you probably want to install all of Dabo's dependencies separately so that you can keep them updated as needed. See <xref linkend="dabo-ch-3"/> for instructions on setting up your development environment.</para>
