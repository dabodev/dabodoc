The .dia files are the actual source files, in dia format which is xml. The
.png files were created using the export function in dia, and should not be
saved to source control. However, I don't know how to convert from dia to
png without having dia installed, so for now I'm including the png files
so that everyone can view them.

If you want to edit a diagram, please edit the .dia version and not the .png
version.
