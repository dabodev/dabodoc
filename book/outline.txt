III. Guided Tour

	(Start with an itch that needs to be scratched, such as your wife's need for a 
	simple recipe management system. Define and design each tier, and implement in
	Dabo. Break out frequently to explain new concepts and syntax as we go, but put
	all the code together in one place at the end of each chapter for conciseness.
	
	Build an app from start to finish, including application deployment, albeit a 
	simple example of it.)
